Back Story
----------

Towards the beginning of 2016, Will and Sheila decided to step down as
maintainers of pyvideo.org. You can read more about why they stepped down at
`Will's blog`_.

In that same blog post, Will suggested that the Python community would step
up to carry on the torch of pyvideo.org. pytube.org is one of the community's
responses to this call to action.

Why the name change?
--------------------

In the months after Will's post, there was some uncertainty about where
pyvideo.org was going and what pyvideo.org would become. 
Pytube.org was set up to be a functional replacement at a moment's notice.
Because this new iteration of pyvideo.org needed to be fully functional and easy
to access, Paul Logston set up a new domain: pytube.org.

Are there plans to switch back to pyvideo.org?
----------------------------------------------

Not at the moment. All of the links from pyvideo.org should still be valid and
given the overhead of changing back to pyvideo.org, the benefits do not appear
to be worth the cost.

Who manatains Pytube.org?
-------------------------

Pytube is maintained by a number of volunteers. The best place to see the list
of volunteers is on the `contributors page on github`_.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the site, feel free to IM the
team on gitter_ or email us at `pytube.org@gmail.com`_.
