:title: Thank You

A little over six months ago, serious work on a new PyVideo began.
The goal of this PyVideo was to carry the torch that was at risk of
burning out (see `Welcome to the new PyVideo`_).
Prior to PyCon 2016, the new site was a humble skeleton of what it is
now and the data (although a tremendous archive with over 3000 videos
catalogued) was one half of what is now. As PyCon 2016 hit, a team of 20+
developers sprinted together to ensure this work was not lost.

.. _`Welcome to the new PyVideo`: /pages/thanks-will-and-sheila.html

Now, half a year later, we have a stellar statically generated site and
6276 videos catalogued (and counting). In the past month alone,
PyVideo.org has serviced almost 15,000 users, 50,000 page views,
and 149 countries. That's over 75% of all counties on the face of the planet.
If you count from the beginning of when we started to collect stats, we've
served pages to over 93% of the countries on the planet. Just check out this 
Google analytics map:

This simply would not have been possible without the support of the
Python community. Here are just a few of the developers that
have chipped in their time:

- AMiT Kumar
- Adam Gibson
- Allison Carlisle
- Andrew Kuchling
- Andy Dirnberger
- Brett Cannon
- Bryce Jasmer
- Cameron Dershem
- Carol Willing
- Christian Roth
- Daniel-at-github
- David Baumgold
- David Hoffman
- Dean Silfen
- Dustin Ingram
- Elliot Hughes
- Emad Mokhtar
- Glyph
- Horst Gutmann
- Ian Robertson
- Jeremy Bowman
- John Johnstone
- Jon Banafato
- Katie McLaughlin
- Kevin Markham
- Laura Hampton
- Lucas Kushner
- Markus Holtermann
- Matthew Boehm
- Matthew Scott
- Michael Kennedy
- Nic Dinkins
- Paul Collins
- Paul Tremberth
- Piotr Bulinski
- Sarah Guido
- Sheila Miguez
- Thomas Fors
- Ulrich Petri
- Will Kahn-Greene
- William Stewart
- anand21nanda
- ivan-bilan
- joshmorel

These developers are hard working, kind, and supportive.
I'm very fortunate to work with such a wonderful team.

So, finally, Thanks.

Thanks for helping grow one of those Python resources that
I believe helps Python developers at all levels push their envelope
of skills and reach towards the developers they want to be.
