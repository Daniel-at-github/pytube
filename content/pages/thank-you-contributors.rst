:title: Thank You

A little over six months ago, serious work began on a new PyVideo.
The goal was to carry a torch that was at risk of going out 
(see `Welcome to the new PyVideo`_). Before PyCon 2016, the new site was a
humble skeleton of what it is now. The data -- although a tremendous archive,
with over 3,000 videos catalogued -- was half of what is now. As PyCon 2016
hit, a team of 20-plus developers sprinted together to ensure this
work was not lost.

.. _`Welcome to the new PyVideo`: /pages/thanks-will-and-sheila.html


Now, half a year later, we have a statically generated site with 6,276
videos and counting. In the past month alone, PyVideo.org has serviced
almost 15,000 users in 149 countries and generated 50,000 page views.
That's more than three-quarters of all countries on earth, and from when
we started collecting stats, we've served pages to 93% of the countries
on the planet. Just check out this Google analytics map:

This simply would not have been possible without the support of the
Python community. Here are just a few of the developers that
have chipped in their time:

- AMiT Kumar
- Adam Gibson
- Allison Carlisle
- Andrew Kuchling
- Andy Dirnberger
- Brett Cannon
- Bryce Jasmer
- Cameron Dershem
- Carol Willing
- Christian Roth
- Daniel-at-github
- David Baumgold
- David Hoffman
- Dean Silfen
- Dustin Ingram
- Elliot Hughes
- Emad Mokhtar
- Glyph
- Horst Gutmann
- Ian Robertson
- Jeremy Bowman
- John Johnstone
- Jon Banafato
- Katie McLaughlin
- Kevin Markham
- Laura Hampton
- Lucas Kushner
- Markus Holtermann
- Matthew Boehm
- Matthew Scott
- Michael Kennedy
- Nic Dinkins

- Piotr Bulinski
- Sarah Guido
- Sheila Miguez
- Thomas Fors

These developers are hardworking, kind and supportive.
I'm fortunate to work with such a wonderful team.

So, finally, thank you.

Together we've created a resource that helps Python developers at all
levels hone their skills and move toward the developers they want to be.
